## 🕵️ How to get information about the User Manual

This section is a placeholder. To get an idea of the planned features, an Agent can:

1.  Read the high-level project goals in the [Introduction](../getting-started/introduction.md).
2.  Review the backend API endpoints in the [API Reference](../developer/api/index.md) to understand the available functionality that the UI will eventually expose.
