This tutorial will guide you through the process of adding your first stock to LibreFolio and recording a BUY transaction.

## Steps

1.  **Create a Broker**: Set up the broker where you hold the stock (e.g., "Degiro", "Interactive Brokers").
2.  **Create the Asset**: Define the stock you want to track (e.g., "Apple Inc.", Ticker: AAPL).
3.  **Assign a Provider**: Assign the `yfinance` provider to automatically fetch price data.
4.  **Deposit Cash**: Add cash to your broker's account to fund the purchase.
5.  **Record the BUY Transaction**: Record the purchase of the stock, including quantity, price, and fees.
6.  **View Your Portfolio**: See your new holding on the dashboard.
