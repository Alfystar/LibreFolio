# Backend Test Walkthrough

This guide explains the backend test suite, broken down by the categories defined in `test_runner.py`.

## Test Categories

-   **Utilities**: Pure functions for math, date, and decimal operations.
-   **Services**: Core business logic.
-   **Database**: Schema, constraints, and data integrity.
-   **API**: REST endpoint validation.
-   **External**: Tests for providers that make live network calls.

For each category, a dedicated page will explain the purpose of the tests, show how to run them, and interpret the output.
