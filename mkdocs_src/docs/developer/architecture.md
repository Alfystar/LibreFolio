# Architecture Overview (WIP)

This page summarizes LibreFolio's architecture and splits the description between backend and frontend.

## Backend Architecture
- FastAPI + SQLModel + SQLite
- Services: FX, Asset Source, Metadata, Synthetic Yield
- Alembic migrations
- Test harness via `test_runner.py`

## Frontend Architecture (Placeholder)
- React + TypeScript + MUI
- To be documented once the frontend is stabilized
