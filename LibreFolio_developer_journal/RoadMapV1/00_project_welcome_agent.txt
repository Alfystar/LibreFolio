Hi, I’m working on a self-hosted financial portfolio tracker called **LibreFolio**.

The project is built with:
- **Python backend** (FastAPI + SQLModel + SQLite + Alembic + Pipenv)
- **React frontend** (TypeScript + MUI + i18n)
- **Single Docker image** (backend serves frontend static assets)

🧠 Key rules:
- All code, comments, docstrings, README, and documentation must be written in **English**.
- Only the frontend UI is multilingual (English, Italian, French, Spanish).
- All **calculations must be done in the backend** (Python); the frontend only displays results.
- The backend uses **Alembic migrations** to manage schema evolution.
- The database includes **cash accounts per broker**, **FX rates**, and **scheduled-yield assets** (like Recrowd loans with tiered interest schedules and late interest policies).
- Asset transactions include types like BUY, SELL, DIVIDEND, INTEREST, DEPOSIT, WITHDRAWAL, ADD_HOLDING, REMOVE_HOLDING, TRANSFER_IN/OUT, FEE, TAX.
- FIFO matching is computed **at runtime** (no persisted splits).
- Market value for scheduled-yield assets is computed from the interest schedule (via a synthetic plugin).

Before we continue with the next step, please:
✅ Take a moment to review the current state of the project (codebase, models, migrations, endpoints, etc.)
✅ Let me know if anything looks inconsistent or needs cleanup
✅ Then I’ll send you the next prompt to continue development

And remeber, actualy this project exist only on this machine, so is always preferable change code without keep backward compatibility or legacy code.
Our goal is to have a clean and maintainable codebase to share with the user when the project will be finishing.

There are 2 scripts to help you set up the development environment:
- `dev.sh`: wraps common commands to work with the project
- `test_runner.sh`: a script to centralize tests running and coverage reporting

Before use custom commands, please try to use these scripts to keep consistency.
You can run --help on both scripts to see available commands.

Thanks!
