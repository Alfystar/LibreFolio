Goal: Start APScheduler to run periodic jobs.

Requirements:
- jobs/scheduler.py: start on app startup; graceful shutdown.
- jobs/tasks.py:
  - refresh_recent_prices every settings.scheduler_interval_min minutes (active assets).
  - daily_history_sync nightly for last 30 days.
  - daily_fx_sync nightly for last 7 days.
- API manual trigger: POST /tasks/run?name=refresh_recent_prices (or other job names)

Checklist:
- Jobs log start/end; manual trigger works.
