Goal: Implement core pages wired to backend; computations must come from backend.

Requirements:
- Overview: fetch /portfolio/overview; render dual-line (Invested vs Market) with ECharts; KPI cards; filters (date/broker/type).
- Brokers: list; broker detail shows assets metrics and cash accounts with balances; DEPOSIT/WITHDRAW/TRANSFER modals wired to API.
- Assets: list; detail shows dual-line series, price history table, transactions table; “Analyze (FIFO)” calls /analysis/asset and displays matches & KPIs.
- Transactions: forms for BUY, SELL (with optional dry_run), DIVIDEND, INTEREST, ADD/REMOVE, TRANSFER (asset), and cash DEPOSIT/WITHDRAW/TRANSFER.
- ❗All calculations must be returned by backend; frontend focuses on presentation; backend may cache results if needed.

Checklist:
- SELL oversell error surfaced nicely.
- Cash ops update balances via query invalidation.
- Charts display server-provided series as-is.
