Goal: Provide DB GUI guidance, reset/seed scripts including a loan asset with tiered interest and late policy, and Bruno API tests.

Tasks:
1) DB GUI Guidance (README section “Debugging SQLite”):
   - Explain how to open ./data/sqlite/app.db with DB Browser for SQLite / SQLiteStudio / DBeaver (prefer read-only or file copy while container runs).

2) Scripts:
   - scripts/reset_db.py: either delete DB file + `alembic upgrade head`, or full downgrade/upgrade cycle.
   - scripts/seed_demo.py: create demo dataset:
     - Brokers: "Directa", "BrokerX"
     - Assets:
       - VWCE.DE (ETF, MARKET_PRICE, plugin yfinance)
       - AAPL (STOCK, MARKET_PRICE, plugin yfinance)
       - RECROWD-LOAN-001 (CROWDFUND_LOAN, valuation_model=SCHEDULED_YIELD)
         interest_schedule:
           [
             {"start_date":"2025-01-01","end_date":"2025-06-30","annual_rate":0.08,"compounding":"SIMPLE","day_count":"ACT/365"},
             {"start_date":"2025-07-01","end_date":"2025-12-31","annual_rate":0.085,"compounding":"SIMPLE","day_count":"ACT/365"}
           ]
         maturity_date: "2025-12-31"
         late_interest: {"annual_rate":0.12,"grace_days":0}
         face_value per unit: 1.00
     - Cash: DEPOSIT EUR 10,000 into Directa.
     - Transactions:
       - BUY 5,000 EUR of RECROWD-LOAN-001 on 2025-01-02 (quantity = 5000 units @ price 1.0)
       - INTEREST payments as explicit transactions on selected dates (e.g., monthly or bullet at maturity) for testing,
         and one SELL at maturity (principal repayment) if desired.
       - Also a BUY/SELL for VWCE.DE to test FIFO runtime.
   - Scripts runnable via Pipenv.

3) Bruno (tests/bruno/):
   - Collection with env/baseUrl var: http://localhost:8000/api/v1
   - Requests:
     * health
     * create brokers/assets (or rely on seed)
     * cash deposit
     * BUY loan units; verify cash decreased
     * GET analysis/asset for RECROWD-LOAN-001 range: confirm daily accrued market value rises in line with schedule
     * SELL oversell negative case: should return 400
     * yfinance refresh for VWCE.DE
     * Optional: INTEREST payment transaction and check cash increased

Deliverables:
- scripts, Bruno collection, README updates (how to run/reset/seed and run Bruno).

Checklist:
- reset + seed OK; DB opens in GUI; loan asset exists with schedule JSON.
- Bruno analysis on loan shows increasing market curve per schedule.
